Book Search Engine
Description
This application is a search engine for books. The user is presented with a search input field and submit button, as well as an option to login or signup. A search will result in several results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. One must be logged in to enable the capability to save books, which are compiled into a retrievable list with the option to remove previously saved titles.

Behind the scenes, it consists of a Google Books API search engine, built with a RESTful API, which is then refactored to be a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. It is a full-stack MERN application (MongoDB-Express.js-React-Node.js), deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
